            <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>
            <h4>The Babylon Bee</h4>

            <p>
                Once you know the rule of thirds, you begin to see it everywhere. Close in pictures have
                the head in the top third and/or in the left or right third of the image. Text or symbols
                will be offset to the other side of the subject and also often in the upper third.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an amateur and as someone with no design or photography experience I have always assumed
                that centering the subject was the right way to go. Now that I have learned the rule of thirds
                I am able to see the ways in which putting the subject off center actually makes them
                more visually important.

            <h3>Contrast</h3>
            <h4>XKCD</h4>
            <a href="xkcd.com">XKCD.com</a>
            <img src="images/xkcd.jpg" alt="XKCD.com screenshot">
            <p>
                Contrast is important for creating websites that really work visually. The more you pay
                attention to contrast the easier your website will be to read and understand.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most basic rule of contrast is to make sure text has sufficient contrast with the surrounding
                image or background color. If a light color text is paired with a light color background or
                image then the text can be very difficult to read. It will take the reader extra time to
                figure out what is going on and will cause a sense of frustration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another princple of contrast is to make sure elements within the page have contrasting
                colors when they have contrasting functions. For instance, borders between similar elements
                of the page like thumbnails to external content may have a different color from the internal
                content.

            <h3>Whitespace</h3>
            <h4>Drudge Report</h4>
            <a href="drudgereport.com">drudgereport.com</a>
            <img src="images/drudge.jpg" alt="drudgereport.com screenshot">
            <p>
                Whitespace will help relax and guide your reader through the website. A web page
                that is completely full of content leaves the reader with a sense of clutter
                and without clear direction about how to move from one section to another.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adding whitespace will help break your thematic sections apart from each other visually
                and guide the readers eyes through the content more naturally. In the drudgereport
                screenshot you can see that the images are all left aligned with whitespace to the right.
                This breaks the sets of links into sections that naturally go together. This also gives the
                reader a break from the monotony of endless lists of article links.
            </p>
            <p>
                Off the topic of whitespace you can also see that drudge has missed some details
                in their small screen or mobile version. The website logo is overlapping the primary
                article link a little. If you look at it on a larger device you can see that it is meant
                to have some vertical space between the headline article title and the page logo.
